# Pa11y Dashboard ‚Äî Local Execution (No MongoDB)

This version of **Pa11y Dashboard** is customized to work entirely **locally**, without requiring MongoDB or the external Pa11y Webservice.  
It performs accessibility audits using **Pa11y (CLI)** directly from Node.js and stores **tasks and results** persistently in the browser‚Äôs **IndexedDB**.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- üß± **No MongoDB or external services** ‚Äî runs fully offline.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Local analysis** ‚Äî executes Pa11y through Node.js.
- üíæ **Browser persistence** ‚Äî stores tasks and results in IndexedDB.
- üìà **Full run history** ‚Äî shows number of executions and timestamps.
- üîÅ **True persistence between restarts** ‚Äî tasks and results remain saved.
- üìä **Live graphs** ‚Äî display error, warning, and notice metrics.

## üí° Local Execution

1. Install dependencies:

    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

3. Open your browser at:

    ```
    http://localhost:4000
    ```

3. Create new tasks and run them directly.  
   The results are stored in **IndexedDB**, remaining available across browser sessions and server restarts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Issues with Puppeteer Installation

In some environments (such as corporate networks), Puppeteer may fail during installation when attempting to download **Chromium**.  
To prevent this, you can instruct it to use your local installation of **Google Chrome** instead.

### ü™ü Windows

1. (Optional) Clean previous installation:

    ```cmd
    rmdir /s /q node_modules
    del /q package-lock.json
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the dashboard:

    ```cmd
    npm run start
    ```
4. Setup Environment:

	```cmd
	set "PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true"
	set "PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
	npm install
	```

### üêß Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. (Optional) Clean previous installation:

    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the dashboard:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
4. Setup Environment:

	```bash
	export PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true
	export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome
	npm install
	```

To make the variables permanent:

```bash
echo 'export PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

> üí° These variables prevent Puppeteer from trying to download Chromium from `storage.googleapis.com`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

| Variable                    | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD`   | Prevents Puppeteer from downloading Chromium during `npm install`.               |
| `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | Defines the path to the existing Chrome or Chromium executable.                 |

## üß† Technical Explanation

- **Pa11y** performs audits using Puppeteer.  
- **IndexedDB** keeps all tasks and results inside the browser, ensuring full data persistence even after restarting the server.  
- When you restart the dashboard (`npm start`), all tasks, results, and charts are automatically reloaded from IndexedDB.

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

- Installation completes without errors on restricted networks.  
- Dashboard works entirely offline.  
- Tasks, runs, and results remain persistent.  
- Accessibility audits run successfully without MongoDB or external APIs.
